	<h1>Introduction</h1>
	<p>I'm a simple guy who loves programming, math and economics. Hoping to meld and merge these subjects into one great project to help the world make better economic decisions. I've learned above everything else though to love and grow is the greatest achievement in life.

	<h1>More About me</h1>
	<h2>What are your favorite hobbies?</h2>
	<p>
	<ul>
	<li>Programming, reading, math, puzzles</li>
	<li>Learning History and understanding human behavior</li>
	<li>Watching bad movies on Netflix and laughing hysterically</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>What's your dream job?</h2>
	<p>Any job that allows me to continuously learn, helps the general public and has some component of technology,programming and computing would be awesome</p>
	<h2>Who's your favorite mathematician?</h2>
	<p>
	That would have to be David Hilbert . His great (yet largely unrecognized) contribution to physics through Hilbert Spaces. His passion for pushing others to discovery through his 23 problems and of course the long line of mathematicians that in some form or fashion attribute their work to the inertia generated by David Hilbert.
	</p>
	<h2>What's your favorite programming language</h2>
	<p>
	Python! The first language I ever delved into and by far the one that has given me the most long nights and satisfaction! Also would love to learn new languages especially Go and/or Java.
